# ChalkArch

## CURRENTLY WIP, DO NOT TRUST IT TO INSTALL A DAILY DRIVER (IT CAN, BUT STILL.)

An Arch Linux installer script written in bash. To use, connect to the internet in the live iso and:

```
pacman -Sy
pacman -S git
git clone https://github.com/Chalksies/ChalkArch
cd ChalkArch
bash ChalkArch.sh
```

Does not currently offer using the exsiting partition table. Will wipe your data!
